# tgteambot
Hello there, fellow!

This project is not something new, and we are pretty sure it has been replicated
multiple times, but this is an experience for us, so there ya go!

This is the 'tgteambot' or Teamificator (that is how we call it)
It is capable of dividing the ones in the chat, who evoked the '/reg'
statement into teams.

Currently it can only divide into two teams, but we are planning on changing it
and add even more features!

It is buildt using Python, SQLite3 and pyTelegramBotAPI made by @eternnoir

Enjoy!!
